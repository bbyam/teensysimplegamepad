/* ===========================================================================
   This software implements a generic gamepad with one 2-axis (four direction)
   D-Pad and 1 or more button.  The intended usage is that all of these files
   remain constant, and only the file simple_gamepad_config.h is modified to
   specify the configurable parameters for the gamepad

   simple_gamepad.c
   This defines the main entry point, initial configuration, and loop
   ======================================================================== */

#define CPU_PRESCALE(n) (CLKPR = 0x80, CLKPR = (n))


int main(void)
